# Deep-Recognition
Flask project for face recognition with deep learning and neural networks.(Project in progress)

## how it works :
1. User registers and uploads his image using register user service.
2. Image is processed to extract identification points for face detected.
3. For validating, user uploads image (or camera feed can be used) to send image to validation service.
4. Face encodings of validation image are compared to user records to get a confidence score.

## tools we may use :
1. Flask ,Celery , Redis ,MongoDB
2. dlib face detection library
